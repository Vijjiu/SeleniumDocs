Java is a programming language owned by oracle.
Java has been developed by a person named James Gosling in the year 1995.
Java is an open source.
Java supports object oriented programming concepts.
Java is platform independent.
Java is case sensitive. There is a difference lowercase and uppercase characters.

//This is my first java program
public class HelloWorld
{

	public static void main(String args[])//main is a method
	{
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}

{} - Curly braces
[]-  Square Brackets
()-  paranthesis
;-   Semi colon
"-   Double Quotation
' -  Single Quotation
//-  Forward Slash for Comments

Class name is -> HelloWorld
Class Contains one main method

helloworld is different from HelloWorld why?? Java is case Sensitive

Points to be Noted:
---------------------
1. The Programm name should be given as same name as class Name.
   ex: HelloWorld.java

2. java is the extension

3. Java Execution Flow->It has two steps....


  a. Compilation-> Checks the syntax errors

	Goto the command line and type-> 

       input -> HelloWorld.java
  
       javac HelloWorld.java

		(or)

        "c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_25\bin\javac" HelloWorld.java


        Ouput -> HelloWorld.class



  b. Execution->JVM Java virtual machine is responsible for storing
     variables and objects in the memory. JVM is an interpreter(executes the code line-by-line)
     JVM converts the .class file into machine level language.


       input -> HelloWorld.class

       java HelloWorld

       output->Prints "Hello World" in the console.

4. Java is platform independent-->".class" generated during compilation phase
works on all the platforms without any modifications. So, java is platform independent.

Ex: Compile a program on windows, and copy the .class to linux and execute the program on linux using
jvm.


Compile once and execute on any platform specific jvm for the operating system.
