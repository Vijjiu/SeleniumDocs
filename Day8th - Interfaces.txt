What is abstract Method?
------------------------

public abstract void engine();


Interfaces:
--------------

Inheritance- reusability
Abstract Class- If the method is incomplete then the class is also abstract

Selenium WebDriver is an automation tool mainly useful to test on multiple browsers


	interface WebDriver
	{
		public abstract void close();
		
		public abstract void LaunchBrowser();
		 

	}

	public class FirefoxDriver implements WebDriver
	{


	}
	public class InternetExplorerDriver implements WebDriver
	{


	}

1. Interface is a java block  which contains 100% abstract  methods.


2. Interface methods are by default public and abstract.

3. Static modifier is not allowed for the methods in the interface which are abstract. Static methods 
cannot be inherited to the subclass.


4. In interface variables are final(constants). We have to intialize the variabls
at the declaration only.

	final variables means-> values once assigned cannot be re-assigned.

5. In interfaces variables are 'public static final' by default.

6. 'implements' is the keyword we have to use for interfaces.

7. Aclass can implement multiple interfaces. The class should implement all the abstract methods in an interface.

8. If a class is implementing an interface we can write in java as

	WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
	driver.closeBrowser();


	 		if(ff)
 		{
 			WebDriver driver = new FireFoxDriver();
 		}
 		else if(IE)
 		{
 			 WebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();
 		}
		else if(CH)
		{
 			WebDriver driver = new ChromceDriver();
		}
		driver.launchBrowser(url);
