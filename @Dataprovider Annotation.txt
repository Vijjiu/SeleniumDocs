@DataProvider
-------------------


In order to store the multiple set of input data we use @DataProvider.

We are going to read the xls file which contains input data and store in @Dataprovider.


 Steps to achieve :
 ----------------------

  a. Store the input data in an xls file.

  b. Read the data from the xls using an third party jar jxl2.6.jar

   jxl jar download link ->http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.sourceforge.jexcelapi/jxl/2.6.12
   jxl stands for -> java excel library
	
 c. Add the jar to the build path.


   Workbook contains 3 sheets. They are referred by index / sheet name.
   Sheet contains rows and columns.
   We call the data is stored in the excel as  cell
   Store the data into the 2-D array.
 
  d. Store the data in @Dataprovider
  e. Use the @Dataprovider in the @Test methods.


JExcel API ->http://jexcelapi.sourceforge.net/resources/javadocs/2_6_10/docs/
