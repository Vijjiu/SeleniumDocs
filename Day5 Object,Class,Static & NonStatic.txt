JAva supports object oriented programming concepts.

What is object??
Object is an real world entity which has state and behaviour.

Car Object:
----------------
	color,weight - state(Variables)
	engine(),wheeling(),steering()- behaviour(Methods)

Bird
animal
Bicyle
Student
	rollno,marks,name-state
	play(),read()- behaviour

Vehicle

Customer
	name,accno,custid,dob,age,address
	withdraw(),checkbalance(),deposit(),transfer()

So, in java programs, state means variables and behaviour means methods.

int i =10;

public class Car
{

        color,weight - state(Variables)
	engine(),wheeling(),steering()- behaviour(Methods)

	//Syntax for creating an object
	Car maruthi = new Car();

	Car bmw = new Car();




}

Student Object:
-------------------

State:name,rollno,age
Behaviour:play(),read()

public class Student
{

State:name,rollno,age
Behaviour:play(),read()
public static schoolName="h2k";

main()
{
	Student s1 = new Student();
	s1.rollno=1;

	Student s2 = new Student();
	s2.rollno=2;

	syso(Student.schoolName);


}

}
 
Constructor:
--------------
A Constructor is a special method which is having same name as className but it doesnt have
any return value.

methods have parantheis()

		
public class Student
{


	Student() // constructor
	{

	}


}

1. Constructors are invoked during the creation of object.

2. Constrcutors are helpful for intialize the variables.

3. constructor which are having paramters are known as paramterized constructor.
   Student s1 = new Student(1,'A',"sudheer");	 

4. A constructor which are not having paramters are known as default constructor.


this:
-----------

this is a keyword helpful to distinguish the local and global variables.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Student(int rollno,char standard,String name)//param constructor
	{
		this.rollno = rollno;
		this.standard = standard;
		this.name= name;
		
	}
