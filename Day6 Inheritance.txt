Inheritance:
--------------
(reusability)
The process of inheriting variables and methods from superclass to subclass
is known as inheritance.

2. The class members inherited from a class is known as superclass.

3. The class members inherited to a class is known as subclass.

4. The superclass is also known as baseclass/parent class.

5. The subclass is also known as derived class/child class.

6.****Only non-static class members are inherited from super class to subclass.


Note: Non - static class members are at the object levelEx: roll
      Static class members are at the class level.Ex: schoolname

7. Static class members are not inherited from superclass to subclass.

8. 'extends' is the keyword useful to maintain the relationship between
superclass and subclass.

9. They are total 3 types of inheritance in java are as follows:

                a. Single Inheritance

		b. Multi level Inheritance


		c. Multiple Inheritance(Its not allowed in java)


10. Single Inheritance:

          Vehicle- Super Class
          Car-SubClass

Overriden methods: If two methods which are having same name and same parameters
available in superclass and subclass known as overriden methods


11.Multi level Inheritance

	  Vehicle - Super Class
          Car-    - extends Vehicle
	  RacingCar-  extends Car

12. Multiple Inheritance: MI is not allowed in java due to diamond problem
	public class Swift extedns classA, classB // this is not allowed in java
	We can extned only one class in java.
