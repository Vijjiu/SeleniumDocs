Eclipse is an IDE(Integrated dev Env) useful to creating Java Proj,Writing Java Programs
and Executing Java Programs.


Steps for downloading Eclipse
-----------------------------
Link for downloading Eclipse https://eclipse.org/downloads/
Package to download is ->Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers, 254 MB
Eclipse is downloaded to the windows in zip format.
Unzip the file to a particular location and click on eclipse.exe


In a java project it contains two folders

src contains java programs
bin contains class files. When the compilation automatically in eclipse it stores the class files in the bin folder


Datatype:
---------------
Datatypes helps to store values in a variable. They are total 8 datatypes in java.


int x=5;

Datatype  -  Size
----------------------
byte	     1byte   8bits b=-128 to 127;  byte b = -128;
short	     2 bytes
int	     4 bytes
long	     8 bytes for storing time in milliseconds. 10 *60*60*1000
            -----------Integers

float	     4 bytes  float f = 2.5f;
double       8 bytes  double d = 2.5;

	     ----------Decimal numbers

char	     2 byte Character code char c = 'a';
boolean	     true or false         boolean b = true;

Variable:
----------------
Variables helps to store the values. Also the name implies which varies the value
is called an variable.

		int i=5; Assigning a value of 5 in variable i of type integer.

		i=6;		


		LHS  =RHS;

		int i ;Declartion of integer variable

		i=5; //Assingment

		i=6;

	Declaration happens only once. But Assignment happens 'n' number of times

Rules for Creating the Variable Names:
-----------------------------------------
1. Single Character is allowed for vnames.
2. Group of characters are allowed for vnames.
3. Alphanumeric characters are allowed for vnames.
    (Combination of characters and numbers) a1,b1,student1
4. Variable names should start with character but not numbers
5. Keywords which are reserved/predefined cannot be used for vnames. 



Eclipse shortcuts -> syso ctrl+space
                     Execute ctrl+F11
