List & Set
-------------

Array is a data structure to store values of similar data types.
Syntax:

          Datatype arrayname[] = new Datatype[size];


List & Set are also data structures to store objects belongs to same class.


	String s1 = new String("selenium");

 int is a datatype. Integer i= new Integer(5);

In java for every datatype they have provided classes. These classes are known as wrapper classes.

Wrapper Classes are as follows: Integer,Short,Byte,Long,Float,Double,Character,Boolean available in the java.lang

			Integer i = new Integer(5);

java.util

	int a[]={1,2,4,5,6};  a[0]

List and Set are the data structures useful to store multiple objects.

Diff between List & Set
------------------------

List is the datastructure useful to store duplicate objects.
String s1 = new String("abc");
String s2 = new String ("abc");

List is index based. We can access the objects using index.--> L1.get(0)
List is an interface implemented by classes LinkedList,Vector and ArrayList.

1. Adding objects to list
2. Retrive a single object(Required in Selenium)get()
3. Size of the list->size()
4. Using for loop (Required in Selenium )



Set is the datastructure useful to store unique objects.
Set is not an index based. It doesnt have get method available in set.
Set is an interface implemented by classes Hashset,Treeset and LinkedHashSet
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

List & Set are interfaces they are availble in the package java.util
LinkedList,ArrayList,Vector are classes which are implementing List
HashSet,TreeSet,LinkedHashSet are classes which are implementing Set.
