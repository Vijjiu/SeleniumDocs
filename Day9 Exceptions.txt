Exception is an abnormal condition. In java, exception is an event that disrupts the normal execution flow of the program.Exceptions are usually nothing but recovery scenario.

Advantages of Exception:
------------------------------
Let's take a scenario:
statement 1;  
statement 2;  
statement 3;  
statement 4;  
statement 5;//exception occurs  
statement 6;  
statement 7;  
statement 8;  
statement 9;  
statement 10;  

Suppose there are 10 statements in your program and there occurs an exception at statement 5, rest of the code will not be executed i.e. statement 6 to 10 will not run. If we perform exception handling, rest of the exception will be executed. That is why we use exception handling in java.


In java they are two types of Exceptions which are as follows:

1. Checked Exception(Compile Time Exceptions Ex: IOException)- 
----------------------------------------------------------------
CheckedExceptions are thrown  during Compile Time.

a. If the compiler is forcing the user to write the code in try/catch block  or throws. Then those exceptions are compile Time Exceptions.

b. Not Every method is required to put try/catch block only for the methods which are having throws keyword, for them compiler will force to put try/catch block or throws.

c. Exception is the super class for all the compile Time Exceptions.

try/catch will continue with execution even when we get exceptions
throws will abort the execution even when we get exceptions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. UnChecked Exception(RunTime Exceptions)-

UnCheckedException are thrown during run time.

RunTime Exceptions are mainly occured due to programmatical flaws done by the programms.
       
These are caught during RunTime. Thats the reason we call them as RunTime Exceptions.


Ex: 
ArithmeticExcepion - Divide by Zero.
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException- Trying to access an array element which is not available.
NullPointerException- Retriving the length() of null String.		
NumberFormatException- Converting a String to Integer




RunTimeException Class is the super class for all the RunTime(unchecked) Exception.


Advantages:
--------------------

Exceptions will help us to proceed further even if we face issues in the code.
Exceptions helps us to prevent from abnormal termination of the program.


Exceptions in Selenium
------------------------
	In Selenium we always look for attributes to identify the elements.

	<input id="username" name="username" type="text">


	try
	{

		driver.findElement(By.id("username12345"))//NoSuchElementException which is                 an run time Exception.



	}catch(


RunTime Exceptions
-------------------
NoSuchElementException
NoSuchFrameException
noSuchWindowException
NoSuchAlertException
InvalidSelectorException
